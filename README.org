Shapely produces compact human-readable representations of nested
collections, with some special treatment for tensors, numpy arrays etc.

* Usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC python 

>>> from shapely import shape
>>> coll = [list(range(100)), {i:(i+1) for i in range(25)}]
>>> print(shape(coll))
[('L(100)', [0, 1, 2]), ('D(25)', {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3})]

#+END_SRC
